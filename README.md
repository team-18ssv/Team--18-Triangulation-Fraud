Triangulation fraud is a type of online scam where fraudsters use an intermediary to receive and forward stolen goods or merchandise purchased with stolen credit card information. It is a recognized type of online fraud that exploits vulnerabilities in e-commerce and highlights the importance of fraud prevention and detection measures in the retail sector.The objective is to detect triangular fraud so that credit card firms' consumers are not charged for products they did not purchase.

Here we have implemented a Machine learning Model which predicts the Triangular Fraud Detection using the most appropriate dataset. The features used are cash_on_delivery, repeat_retailer, return_policy which are some of the crucial factors in detecting a Triangulation fraud. Various Machine Learning algorithms are implemented and their accuracies are used as an evaluation method.
